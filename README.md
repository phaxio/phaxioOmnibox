Easily find and download faxes in your Phaxio account using this omnibox extension.

Here's how it works.  In the chrome search bar type "Phaxio[tab]".  Then:

- Type "#1234" to view fax with ID 1234
- Type "v1234" to download a PDF of the fax with ID 1234.  (The 'v' is symbolic of a download arrow, get it?)
- Type a phone number (e.g. "18661234567") to search for faxes to that number, or type a tag (e.g. "orderId:1234") to search for faxes with the tag.
